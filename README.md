# 🎮 trickLoop

> A 96-hour game built for the **GMTK Game Jam 2025** — my first complete game and first time using Godot.

## 🌀 What is trickLoop?

**trickLoop** is a fast-paced, combo-driven platformer where you play as a cube on a skateboard wearing a ninja bandana and a scarf (of course).  
The core mechanic lets you **save and reuse your previous moves**, allowing you to chain complex aerial tricks and create stylish, chaotic combos.

Built from scratch using **Godot Engine** during the GMTK 2025 Game Jam, under the theme **"Loop."**
